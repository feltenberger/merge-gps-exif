This program will read a directory full of images in most image formats (_including RAW!_) and, given a CSV of GPS lat/lon and date/time stamps, it will merge the GPS data with the Exif data in the images.

Phil Harvey has kindly allowed me to package ExifTool in the Maven repository and final builds, so there are no external requirements.  But if you're interested, please read about his tool at his website: at http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/

**n.b.** - This is super hyper ultra alpha - it's the first swipe at a proof of concept, but I wanted to put it in a repository so I don't lose it :-)
